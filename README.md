Hello team, welcome to V43-TIER2-TEAM-18! We're excited to have you on board.

## Project Overview

This project is built using Vite and styled with Tailwind. The entire project has been configured to have a "6rem" padding on the horizontal axis just to ease the development process, so please try not to manipulate those.


## Getting Started

Here are the basic steps to run the project:

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v43-tier2-team-18.git`.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

That's it! You should now be able to see the project running locally on your machine.

## Contributing

We encourage all team members to contribute to the project. If you have any ideas or suggestions, please don't hesitate to share them with the team.

Before making any changes to the codebase, please create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-login-page`). Once you have made your changes, create a pull request and request a review from another team member.

## Conclusion
