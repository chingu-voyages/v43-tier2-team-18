        The country is known for its beautiful landscapes, stunning mountain
        ranges, pristine lakes, and world-class skiing resorts. Switzerland
        has four official languages: German, French, Italian, and Romansh,
        which reflect the cultural diversity of the country.
        `,
      culture: `Switzerland has a rich and fascinating history that goes back
      thousands of years. The region was first inhabited by Celtic tribes,
      and then later by the Romans, who established the city of Aventicum in
      15 BC.
    
      Switzerland remained a neutral country during the World Wars, but its
      history during this period is marked by its humanitarian efforts to
      help those affected by the conflicts. Switzerland is also known for
      its tradition of direct democracy, where citizens have a say in the
      laws and policies of the country through regular referendums.
    
      The country is also known for its contributions to science, art, and
      literature. Some of the most famous Swiss personalities include the
      scientist Albert Einstein, the author Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and
      the artist Paul Klee.

      Switzerland is also famous for its cheese and chocolate, which are
      exported all over the world. The country's cuisine is influenced by
      its neighbors, with traditional dishes including fondue, raclette, and
      rosti. Switzerland is also known for its luxury watches, and some of
      the most prestigious brands such as Rolex and Omega are based in the
      country.
    
      The Swiss people are known for their love of nature and outdoor
      activities, with skiing, hiking, and mountain biking being popular
      pastimes. The country also has a strong tradition of precision
      engineering and innovation.`,

      culture: `France has a rich history and culture that has shaped the country into what it is today. The region that is now France was originally inhabited by various Celtic tribes before being conquered by the Romans in the 1st century BC. After the fall of the Roman Empire, France was invaded by various Germanic tribes, and in the 5th century, the Franks established a kingdom that eventually evolved into the Kingdom of France.

      During the Middle Ages, France became a major European power, and in the 16th century, it became a leading center of the Renaissance. France played a key role in the Enlightenment and was the site of the French Revolution in the late 18th century, which led to the establishment of the First French Republic.
      
      Today, France is known for its rich cultural heritage, including its art, literature, and cuisine. French culture has had a significant impact on global culture, and the French language is widely spoken around the world.
